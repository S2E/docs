S2E: The Selective Symbolic Execution Platform
==============================================

S2E is a platform for writing tools that analyze the properties and behavior of software systems. S2E comes as a modular
library that gives virtual machines symbolic execution and program analysis capabilities. S2E runs unmodified x86,
x86-64, or ARM software stacks, including programs, libraries, the kernel, and drivers. Symbolic execution then
automatically explores hundreds of thousands of paths through the system, while analyzers check that the desired
properties hold on these paths and selectors focus path exploration on components of interest.

This documentation explains in details how to set up S2E, how to symbolically execute programs, and how to find
vulnerabilities in them.
